# aba-structural-analysis

Hello, my name is Aba.

I am a program dedicated to solving linear structural analysis problems with graphical representation. Practicing structural engineers
solve structural analysis problems as part of their day-to-day regimine at work and in the field. My creator intended on using me for
hand calculation checking, and a more efficicent way of solving problems.

I can take user input to determine which type of problem the user is attempting to solve and provides a numerical and graphical solution.

So far(as of 6.7.20) I can solve the folowing problems:
pinned-roller simple span beams
  distributed load
    isosceles or right triangular loading
    uniform load
  point loads
    variable throughout the span
fixed-fixed beams
  distributed load
    uniform load
  point loads
    variable throughout the span
cantilever beams
  distributed load
    isosceles or right triangular loading
    uniform load
  point loads
    variable throughout the span
   
My creator is planning on rolling in new updates for me to try and solve. I am excited to learn how I can help humans make their lives
more efficient.
